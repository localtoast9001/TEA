# TEA - Test Expression Adventure

TEA is designed to be a portable language inspired by Object-oriented Pascal but built on the C runtime.
As a language, it has the following goals:
* Use in a broad set of architectures and platforms, similar to where C is used.
* Platform independent common libraries.
* Type safety even through coercion.
* Support Object Oriented Programming concepts of Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
* The language avoids features that can create readability and maintainability problems.

## Language Features
* Encapsulation through classes.
* Single-inheritance model.
* No casting operator.
* Classes can implement interfaces.
* Short-circuiting logic.
* No goto or jump support.
